## 1. Project Overview

BEV-NET is an end-to-end autonomous-driving perception project that converts six surround-view RGB images into a top-down occupancy map. It combines multi-camera feature extraction, geometry-aware BEV projection, BEV decoding, occupancy prediction, evaluation metrics, and an interactive FastAPI demo interface.

The system is built around a custom **BEVOccupancyModel** with four main components: **ImageBackbone**, **BEVFormerLite V3.1**, **BEVDecoder**, and **OccupancyHead**. It outputs a `200 x 200` BEV occupancy grid and supports both dataset-based inference and fixed-calibration custom uploads.

---

## 2. Model Architecture

The model takes 6 camera images plus camera intrinsics and extrinsics as input and produces a BEV occupancy grid as output.

### Why Not Lift-Splat-Shoot?

Our first instinct was a **Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS)** style pipeline — lift each pixel into 3D using predicted depth, splat features into BEV voxels. Simple, fast, well-understood.

**Why it failed for our case:**
- LSS requires a depth prediction module — another learned component that needs supervision not available in nuScenes mini
- With only 404 samples, a depth network never converges properly
- Uncertain depth estimates spread feature mass across voxels, producing blurry BEV maps
- IoU was stuck around **0.15–0.20** because the geometry was fundamentally noisy

LSS works at scale. For a 404-sample dataset, it is the wrong tool.

### The Geometry Insight

> "Instead of predicting depth and then projecting, what if we use **known** camera geometry directly?"

We know the intrinsic matrix **K** and extrinsic matrix **E** for every camera exactly. We do not need to *learn* where things are in 3D — we just need to sample features at geometrically correct places.

| Old Approach (LSS) | Our Approach |
|---|---|
| Image → predict depth → lift to 3D → splat to BEV | Known geometry → define BEV grid points → project back to image → sample features |

For every BEV cell at position `(x, y, z)` in ego coordinates:
```
F_BEV(x,y,z) = sample(F_2D, project(P_ego → camera → image))
```
We ask: *"For this BEV cell, which pixel in which camera should I look at?"* — and we know the **exact answer** from K and E. No learned depth. No additional supervision. The model only needs to learn *what features look like*, not *where things are*.

### The Spatial Problem — Why V2 Was Not Enough

After geometry-aware projection, we reached **IoU 0.30** but **DWE 0.23**. The model was making too many errors near the ego vehicle — the most safety-critical zone.

**What is DWE?**
> DWE weights errors by `1/distance` from ego. A false positive 2 metres away hurts **10× more** than one 20 metres away. A ghost obstacle near you causes an emergency brake; one far away barely matters.

Three diagnosed problems:

| Problem | Root Cause |
|---|---|
| Blurry near-ego predictions | Sampling only at `Z=0` missed bumper and roof-height features |
| Loss / metric mismatch | Training minimised uniform error; eval penalised near-ego errors heavily |
| Soft probabilities near ego | Model outputting `0.6–0.7` instead of sharp `0.05` or `0.95` |

### Our Solutions (V3)

**Solution 1 — Multi-Height Z Sampling**
```python
Z_HEIGHTS = [0.0, 0.5, 1.5]  # ground plane, bumper height, roof height
```
A car is not just on the ground. We sample BEV features at three heights and mean-pool them — capturing the full vertical extent of objects.

**Solution 2 — DWE-Aligned Loss Function**
```python
L_dwe = (dwe_map * abs(prob - GT)).mean()
# dwe_map = 1/dist — mathematically identical to the evaluation metric
```
We made the training loss identical to the evaluation metric. The model now explicitly optimises what it is being judged on.

**Solution 3 — Phased Training Curriculum**
```
Epochs  1– 5:  Warmup   → focal + dice only        (learn basic occupancy shapes)
Epochs  6–40:  Phase 1  → + DWE + confidence + TV  (learn spatial priority)
Epochs 41–60:  Phase 2  → amplified DWE weights     (refine near-ego accuracy)
```
Adding all losses from epoch 1 caused collapse. The curriculum gives the model a stable foundation before applying spatial pressure.

### Components

- **ImageBackbone** — Shared CNN backbone applied to each of the 6 camera views
- **BEVFormerLite V3.1** — Geometry-aware view transformer, samples at Z = [0.0, 0.5, 1.5]
- **BEVDecoder** — 2D BEV refinement network that upsamples and smooths the BEV feature map
- **OccupancyHead** — Produces main occupancy logits and auxiliary logits

### Inputs and Outputs

- **Inputs**: Images `B×6×3×H×W` · Intrinsics `B×6×3×3` · Extrinsics `B×6×4×4`
- **Outputs**: Main occupancy logits `B×1×200×200` · Auxiliary logits `B×1×200×200` · Binary BEV map

## 3. Dataset Used

This project uses the **nuScenes mini** dataset for training and evaluation.

📂 **nuScenes mini used in this project**:  
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1g5KgxG0p8-MmTiXkNtCpoYSIkdBQprEm

| Split | Samples |
|---|---|
| Total | 404 |
| Training | 323 |
| Validation | 81 |

Each sample provides:
- 6 synchronized surround-view RGB camera images
- Camera intrinsics and extrinsics for each camera
- BEV occupancy ground-truth built from LiDAR-based occupancy mapping

The BEV grid is `200 × 200` cells at `0.4 m/cell` → **80 m × 80 m** range around the ego vehicle.

**Relevant Code**
- `data/nuscenes_loader.py` – dataset and dataloaders
- `data/preprocess.py` – image resizing/normalization and calibration preprocessing
- `scripts/extracted_fixed_calib.py`, `scripts/sanity_check_geometry.py` – fixed calibration and geometry sanity checks

### 6.2 Results as a Story

> **IoU went from 0.30 → 0.36 (+21%). But the more important number is DWE: 0.23 → 0.11, a 51% reduction. The model got dramatically better at the thing that matters most for safety — predicting correctly near the vehicle.**

| | V2 Baseline | V3 Ours | Improvement |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| **Overall IoU** | 0.3011 | **0.3649** | **+21.2%** |
| **DWE** | 0.2323 | **0.1137** | **−51.1%** |
| **Precision** | 0.4369 | **0.4520** | +1.5pp |
| **Recall** | 0.5218 | **0.6110** | +8.9pp |
| **F1 Score** | 0.4734 | **0.5146** | +4.1pp |
| **Near-ego IoU** | — | **0.6278** | safety-critical zone |
| **Far-field IoU** | — | **0.3150** | still room to grow |

> **What DWE = 0.11 means**: Our average spatially-weighted prediction error is 11% — with errors near the vehicle penalised up to 100× more than distant ones.

> **Near-ego IoU = 0.63**: In the safety-critical zone within 12 metres, our model is correct nearly **two-thirds of the time**. That is the number an autonomous driving engineer actually cares about.
